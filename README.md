# The-fourth-pillar
This repository contains the source code of my news website.
The website is made using the following-
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap

*Inspiration-
Most of the websites operatiinal today lack in terms of some aspects. Such aspects have been taken care of during the development of this website.
One such aspect is readability. This is the most sought factor in a news website. More the readability of the content is, more is the audience engagement.

*Name
Since press is considered the fourth pillar of a democracy, the website draws its name from the same concept.
